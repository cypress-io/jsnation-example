> Example TodoMVC application for JSNation conference

This example is a fork of the official [Redux TodoMVC example](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc) with a set of [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io) end-to-end tests. The tests run instrumented application code and the code coverage is saved automatically using [cypress-istanbul](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-istanbul) plugin.

## Install and use

```shell
npm ci
npm test
```

The full code coverage HTML report will be saved in `coverage`.

## Code coverage

For details how 100% code coverage works, see [cypress-example-todomvc-redux](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-todomvc-redux)
